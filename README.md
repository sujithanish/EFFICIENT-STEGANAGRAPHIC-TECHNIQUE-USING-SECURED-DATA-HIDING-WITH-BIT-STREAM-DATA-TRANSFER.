# EFFICIENT-STEGANAGRAPHIC-TECHNIQUE-USING-SECURED-DATA-HIDING-WITH-BIT-STREAM-DATA-TRANSFER.
JPEG Steganographic schemes ,  J-UNIWARD, which take into account the effects of embedding in the spatial domain tend to exhibit higher security and introduce less artifacts that can be captured by the prevalent steganalyzers. Following the paradigm,   the proposal of dual image JPEG steganography  one is cover image and another spatial embedding image by incorporating the statistics of both the spatial and DCT domains. The spatial statistics of the decompressed JPEG images are firstly with data and hide in embed space with the distortion measures of some efficient steganographic schemes in the spatial domain, e.g.,  HILL and the result which can be  embedding entropies of  spatial blocks  in alignment with DCT blocks are then transformed  in to the DCT domain to obtain the distortion measures for JPEG  steganography. Experimental results show  method outcome of  image steganographic  state-of-the-art JPEG steganographic schemes, i.e., J-UNIWARD and UERD, for the most effective feature set GFR at present and rivals them for other feature sets, e.g., DCTR and CC-JRM. Most effective one in the method is more security means of transfer of data.
